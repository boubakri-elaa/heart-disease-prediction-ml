# Heart Disease Prediction ML Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using a **supervised Machine Learning approach** with Python and scikit-learn. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with mostly "NO heart disease" cases, which required careful preprocessing and evaluation.

## Objectives
- Master the main Machine Learning techniques in scikit-learn
- Understand the importance of preprocessing and pipelines
- Compare multiple ML models with cross-validation
- Interpret model performance beyond accuracy, using precision, recall, and F1-score

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle / link if available]
- Type: Classification
- Features: 15+ features (age, sex, cholesterol, etc.)
- Notes: Imbalanced dataset (majority "NO" class)

## What I Did
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing values, outliers, encoding, normalization)
2. Built pipelines to avoid data leakage
3. Trained and compared **5+ ML models** (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
4. Evaluated using cross-validation and multiple metrics
5. Visualized results and interpreted model performance

## Key Learning
- Accuracy can be misleading on imbalanced datasets
- Choosing proper evaluation metrics is crucial in healthcare ML
- Hands-on experience with ML pipelines and model comparison
